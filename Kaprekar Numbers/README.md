Kaprekar Numbers - https://www.reddit.com/r/dailyprogrammer/comments/5aemnn/20161031_challenge_290_easy_kaprekar_numbers/

Challenge: Given a range, find all Kaprekar Numbers in that range.

"In mathematics, a Kaprekar number for a given base is a non-negative integer, the representation of whose square in that
base can be split into two parts that add up to the original number again. For instance, 45 is a Kaprekar number, 
because 452 = 2025 and 20+25 = 45. The Kaprekar numbers are named after D. R. Kaprekar." - jnazario.
